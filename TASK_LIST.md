## 태스크 상세 정보

### 1. Project Setup and Configuration
- **상태:** ✅ Done
- **우선순위:** High
- **의존성:** 없음
- **설명:** Initialize the React web application project with necessary dependencies and folder structure.
- **상세 내용:**
```
1. Create a new React application using Create React App or Vite
2. Set up project structure with folders for components, pages, services, and utils
3. Configure ESLint and Prettier for code quality
4. Set up routing with React Router
5. Initialize Git repository
6. Configure package.json with required dependencies including:
   - React
   - React Router
   - State management (Context API or Redux)
   - Date handling library (date-fns or moment)
   - UI component library (optional)
7. Create initial README.md with project description
```
- **테스트 전략:**
```
Verify that the application builds and runs without errors. Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed and the project structure follows best practices.
```

### 2. Design Database Schema
- **상태:** ✅ Done
- **우선순위:** High
- **의존성:** 1
- **설명:** Design the data structure for storing user reflection entries with fields for accomplishments, regrets, and improvements.
- **상세 내용:**
```
Create a database schema that includes:

1. Users table (if authentication is implemented):
   - id (primary key)
   - username/nickname
   - created_at

2. Reflections table:
   - id (primary key)
   - user_id (foreign key to Users)
   - date (the date the reflection is for)
   - created_at
   - updated_at

3. ReflectionEntries table (or use a JSON structure in Reflections):
   - id (primary key)
   - reflection_id (foreign key to Reflections)
   - entry_type (enum: 'accomplishment', 'regret', 'improvement')
   - content (text)

Alternatively, for a simpler local storage approach:
const reflectionSchema = {
  userId: String,
  reflections: [
    {
      date: String, // ISO format
      accomplishments: [String],
      regrets: [String],
      improvements: [String],
      createdAt: String,
      updatedAt: String
    }
  ]
}
```
- **테스트 전략:**
```
Validate the schema design by creating test data and ensuring it can accommodate all required features. Review for normalization, query efficiency, and scalability.
```
